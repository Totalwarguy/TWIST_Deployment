<br>Main Learning Objectives:
  
  <p> Our team was tasked by T.W.I.S.T. (Teen Woman in Science & Technology) to create a signup site for student particpants to sign up for the day's event, and provide an admin panel for the T.W.I.S.T. planner to make adjustments in the signup, presenters, and printing out sessions.
  
  <br>My Contribution to the project
  
  <p> In this project, I was tasked to with Topic and Presenter Controller, models, and addition to the routes. Also, I suggested the initial plan to split our projects to branches and recognize any issues that needs to be immediately discussed.
