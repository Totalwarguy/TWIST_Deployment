# Twist
Here is the website created for the twist program 
<br> Collaborators:
<br> Matt Chumsena, Morgan Perez, Bryan Weikle




<br>Main Learning Objectives:
  
  <p> Our team was tasked by T.W.I.S.T. (Teen Woman in Science & Technology) to create a signup site for student particpants to sign up for the day's event, and provide an admin panel for the T.W.I.S.T. planner to make adjustments in the signup, presenters, and printing out sessions.
  
  <br>My Contribution to the Project:
  
  <p> In this project, I was tasked to with Topic and Presenter controller, models,views, and addition to the routes of the backend. Also, I suggested the initial plan to split our projects to branches and recognize any issues that needs to be immediately discussed. 
  
  <br> Challenges/Solutions:
  
  <p> My issues we're referencing previous projects and completing the implementation portion of the task assigned to me. Trying to complete my work, as all of us we were split on responsibilities. We had to accomplish everything we were assigned on the backend without having enough time to address the front end of the website. When we had questions or running into errors in our controllers/models/views from the previous class period, our team would tackle it together to get it working. Communicating through Slack allowed us to give a heads up what our next meeting objectives. Going through older projects to develop the skeleton to build a new backend for this project was helpful.
  
  <br> Unfinished Work:
  
  <p> Our complete front end for the T.W.I.S.T. project was not complete. Personally, my assignments on Topic and Presenters controllers were not finished as the logic wasn't hammered out. Sessions and Schedule backend were partially completed.
  
  <br>Project Reflection:
  
  <p> Simply, I think we should flip how our team assigned tasks. Our skillset in the whole team was pretty much the same, we could do a little bit of everything until we had a problem where nobody could solve. Bryan mentioned he was good with the HTML, but he accepted the tasks he took under burning our time in the project. Myself, I had issue where I didn't ask the right questions and my bugs in my portion of the project affected our overall productivity of the period as my team spent their time helping me.
